0.0.6 (2017-11-20)
------------------
* Depend on zlib (`#23 <https://github.com/CogRob/catkin_grpc/issues/23>`_) and link protobuf with zlib (`#22 <https://github.com/CogRob/catkin_grpc/issues/22>`_) (`#24 <https://github.com/CogRob/catkin_grpc/issues/24>`_)
* Depend on absolute path of .proto file (`#21 <https://github.com/CogRob/catkin_grpc/issues/21>`_)
  This should fix `#20 <https://github.com/CogRob/catkin_grpc/issues/20>`_. The original concern was for some reason cmake re-generate protos if .proto is not within src. Initial test shows this is not the case, but should do more tests.
