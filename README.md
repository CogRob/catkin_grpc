# `grpc`: Catkinized gRPC Package

This package integrates [gRPC](https://grpc.io) into Catkin/ROS ecosystem.

## Usage

* Put this package in your workspace.

* In `CMakeLists.txt` of your package, include `gprc` in
`find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS )` section.
Example: `find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS grpc)`

* Incldue "`generate_proto(<proto_target> <proto_path>/<proto_name>.proto)`"
rules in your `CMakeLists.txt` (see more below).

* Use "`target_link_libraries`" to link proto target (`<proto_target>` above)
to your library or executable.

* If you will use your `<proto_target>` in another Catkin package, in the
`catkin_package()` statement, include `CATKIN_DEPENDS grpc` and
`LIBRARIES <proto_target> ${ALL_PROTOBUF_LIBS} ${ALL_GRPC_LIBS}` (you can skip
`${ALL_GRPC_LIBS}` if you did not use `GRPC` in `generate_proto`).

## `generate_proto` Features

### Basic Usage
`generate_proto(hello_proto proto/hello.proto)` will generate `hello.pb.h`,
`hello.pb.cc`, and `hello_pb2.py`. You can use them in your source with
`#include "your_package/hello.pb.h"` or `import your_package.hello_pb2`.
`grpc` will generate a library target called `hello_proto`,
linked with `libprotobuf` included in the `grpc` package.  You will only need to
add `target_link_libraries(my_library_or_binaray hello_proto)` to link it to
your depending targets.

### `GRPC`
The `GRPC` option also generates `.grpc.{h,cc}` and `_grpc_pb2.py` files files.
`generate_proto(hello_proto GRPC proto/hello.proto)` will also generate
`hello.grpc.pb.h`, `hello.grpc.pb.cc`, and `hello_grpc_pb2.py`.

### `SRC_BASE`
The generated C++ headers will always be in the global `include` directory in
Catkin `devel` space, and generated Python files will always be in the global
`dist-packages` directory in Catkin `devel` space. They also refer these
directory as their base. However, you can specify your source base using
`SRC_BASE`. Your source base will correspond to global `include` and
`dist-packages` directory.

The default source base is one-level above the package directory, assuming your
package directory name is identical to package name. Therefore, the generated
files will end up in a subdirectory with package name. That is the reason why
`your_package` is necessary in `#include "your_package/hello.pb.h"`. If your
source layout is `catkin_ws/src/your_package/proto/hello.proto`, by default the
source base is `catkin_ws/src`, so `your_package/proto/hello.proto` will convert
to `your_package/proto/hello{.pb.h, .pb.cc, _pb2.py}`, and end up with
`catkin_ws/devel/include/your_package/proto/hello.pb{.h, .cc}` and
`catkin_ws/devel/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/your_package/proto/hello_pb2.py`.
Please note even if your package directory name is not the same as package name,
you should use your **package name** in the include/import path.

You can use `SRC_BASE` to modify such behavior. The argument of `SRC_BASE` is
relative to **your package base directory**, `catkin_ws/src/your_package` in the
above case. If you use
`generate_proto(hello_proto GRPC SRC_BASE "." proto/hello.proto)`, you will get
`catkin_ws/devel/include/proto/hello{.pb.h, .pb.cc, .grpc.pb.h, .grpc.pb.cc}`
and `catkin_ws/devel/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/proto/hello{_grpc_pb2.py,
_pb2.py}`. Your package (and other packages in the same workspace) can use
`#include "proto/hello.pb.h` or `import proto.hello_pb2` to use them.

In another example, if you use `SRC_BASE "proto"`, you will get
`catkin_ws/devel/include/hello.pb{.h, .cc}` and
`catkin_ws/devel/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/hello_pb2.py`, and your package
(and other packages in the same workspace) can use `#include "hello.pb.h`
or `import hello_pb2`. Please note all the package will see these generated
files. Please use caution to avoid namespace pollution.


### `INCLUDE_DIRS`
`generate_proto` has a `INCLUDE_DIRS` keyword to allow searching proto in
additional directories. `INCLUDE_DIRS` accepts multiple arguments, and to
distinguish proto files to compile from include directory, a `FILES` keyword
is necessary before the file list. Example:

```
generate_proto(hello_proto INCLUDE_DIRS dir1 dir2 FILES proto/hello.proto)`
```
